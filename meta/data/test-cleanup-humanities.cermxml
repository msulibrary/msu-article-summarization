      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Many have argued that allowing and encouraging public avenues for dissent and
critical evaluation of scientific research is a necessary condition for promoting the
objectivity of scientific communities
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35 ref65">(Longino 2002; Solomon 2001; Longino
1990)</xref>
        . A scientific community that ensures members are accorded the
opportunity to raise criticisms, offer alternative models and explanations, identify
unjustified background assumptions, and have those objections taken seriously is
thought to be more objective. Such mechanisms are necessary for both limiting
the influence of problematic biases of individual researchers as well as ensuring
that a full range of research projects, hypotheses, models, and explanations
receive adequate attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet despite the epistemic importance of dissent within science, there is
growing concern about the negative role of dissenting voices on public policy.
For instance, private industry and think tanks have funded research whose
primary aim has been to manufacture dissent by generating studies that call into
question widely received views, about climate change, environmental toxins, or
the hazards of smoking
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref28 ref40 ref40 ref41 ref48 ref48 ref5 ref5 ref52 ref52 ref53 ref53 ref55 ref55 ref64 ref64 ref69">(Michaels 2008; Oreskes and Conway 2010a; Oreskes and
Conway 2010b)</xref>
        . In other cases, respectable scientists defend claims that are
entirely inconsistent with widely accepted scientific views
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref13 ref30 ref69">(Duesberg et al. 2003;
Duesberg and Rasnick 1998; Wakefield et al. 1998)</xref>
        . Because such studies
present what appears to be conflicting evidence, they have been used to call into
question government regulations on grounds that there is a lack of scientific
consensus
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref12 ref17 ref28 ref40 ref41 ref42 ref48 ref5 ref52 ref53 ref55 ref64 ref68">(Michaels 2005; Enstrom and Kabat 2003; Vastag 2001; Oreskes and
Conway 2010b; Michaels 2008; Duesberg et al. 2003)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, there are two sorts of negative consequences dissent can have. It
can have negative epistemic consequences when it results in confusion or false
beliefs about the true state of the science, the existence of a scientific consensus,
or the degree to which a claim is supported by evidence. But in cases where the
scientific evidence is relevant for public policy, these negative epistemic
consequences can also have policy consequences. Scientific consensus is often
taken to be a benchmark for scientific knowledge (Longino 2002) and thus
thought to be important for legitimately grounding policy decisions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Jasanoff
2010)</xref>
        . Dissent, insofar as it appears to call into question the scientific consensus,
may make it appear to the public or policymakers that there is not sufficient
evidence to support the adoption of particular public policies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref28 ref28 ref3 ref39 ref40 ref40 ref48 ref48 ref49 ref5 ref5 ref52 ref52 ref53 ref53 ref55 ref55 ref6 ref64 ref64 ref66 ref9">(McGarity and
Wagner 2008; Diethelm and McKee 2009; McKee and Diethelm 2010; Oreskes
and Conway 2010b; Specter 2007; Bateman 2007; Omer et al. 2009)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Motivated by a desire to protect what they take to be scientifically sound
policies, then, many scientists and science studies scholars have adopted strategies
that target dissent thought to be problematic. Some have, for example, attempted
to discredit dissenters by showing their financial ties to industry or political think
tanks.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref28 ref40 ref40 ref41 ref48 ref48 ref5 ref5 ref51 ref52 ref52 ref53 ref53 ref55 ref55 ref64 ref64 ref69">(Michaels 2008; Oreskes 2004; Oreskes and Conway 2010a; Oreskes and
Conway 2010b)</xref>
        . Some scientists have engaged in practices aimed at masking
existing dissent from the public so as to prevent confusion or doubt about the
scientific consensus
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref70">(Waltz 2009; Beatty 2006)</xref>
        . What these strategies have in
common, however, is that they all concede that such dissent – or dissent likely to
have negative epistemic consequences – is an obstacle to justifiably enacting
public policy.
      </p>
      <p>While we share concerns about the extent to which dissent can have
negative consequences, we argue here that targeting dissent as an obstacle to
public policy is both misguided and dangerous. It is misguided because it relies on
problematic assumptions about the nature of dissent and of scientific consensus
and the role of each in public policy development. It is dangerous because
viewing dissent as an obstacle to policy is likely to increase illegitimate instances
of dissent, deprive us of resources to criticize special interest science, and stifle
legitimate scientific dissent that is crucial to scientific progress and sound public
policy. If we are correct, rather than targeting dissent, the focus of discussions
should be finding successful strategies to help the public and policymakers better
understand the nature of consensus and dissent, as well as their role in sound
public policy making.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>2. Worries about scientific dissent</title>
      <p>
        Clearly we want public policies, health advice, or regulatory decisions to be
informed by scientific knowledge
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref19 ref29 ref32 ref45 ref6 ref62 ref8">(Collins and Evans 2007; Selinger and Crease
2006; Bijker et al. 2009; Jasanoff 2004; Kitcher 2011)</xref>
        . The existence of a
scientific consensus is often taken to be a proxy for such knowledge. When –
through rational mechanisms – experts agree on a particular scientific claim, e.g.,
that smoking causes cancer, that anthropogenic causes are responsible for global
warming, or that condoms prevent transmission of HIV, this consensus is thought
to be evidence for the strength of the scientific evidence. Worries about dissent,
then, seem to have to do with its potential to call into question existing scientific
consensus and with it, the legitimacy of using existing scientific evidence as
grounds for public policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent controversies in science-based public policy provide support for
these worries. In some well-publicized cases, for instance, oil, tobacco, and
chemical companies have been shown to fund dissenting scientific studies in an
apparent attempt to generate doubt about current scientific theories
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref39 ref40 ref41 ref46 ref48 ref5 ref52 ref53 ref55 ref64 ref9">(Oreskes and
Conway 2010b; Michaels 2008; McGarity and Wagner 2008; Mooney 2005)</xref>
        . In
some cases, scientists with ties to the tobacco industry produced several studies
that rejected the consensus about a greater risk of lung cancer for smokers
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref40 ref41 ref48 ref5 ref52 ref53 ref55 ref64">(Oreskes and Conway 2010; Michaels 2008)</xref>
        . Similarly, scientists funded by the
chemical industry have published studies that challenged the consensus and
purported to support “hormesis,” the hypothesis that low doses of toxins and
carcinogens have some beneficial health effects for humans
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref63">(Shrader-Frechette
2010; Elliott 2011)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        In another now infamous case, publication of a link between the measles,
childhood vaccines and autism
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref19 ref45 ref62 ref69 ref8">(Wakefield et al. 1998; Geier and Geier 2006,
2007)</xref>
        questioned the scientific consensus and presented the safety of vaccines as
contested knowledge, even when no real disagreement existed in the scientific
community
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref28 ref28 ref31 ref40 ref40 ref40 ref48 ref48 ref48 ref5 ref5 ref5 ref52 ref52 ref52 ref53 ref53 ref53 ref55 ref55 ref55 ref64 ref64 ref64">(Shwed and Bearman 2010; Poland and Spier 2010; Kirby 2005;
Olmsted and Blaxill 2010)</xref>
        . As a result, at least in part because of such dissent,
many parents have rejected vaccinations for their children, risking the loss of herd
immunity for diseases that had been largely eradicated from the industrialized
world
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref27 ref49 ref7">(Omer et al. 2009; Glanz et al. 2009; Jansen et al. 2003; Brown et al. 2010)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Thus, dissenting voices can have considerable negative consequences on
public health and may delay or prevent needed regulations or other sound public
policies. Such dissent can also waste time and resources, both on the side of
scientists and policymakers, when they are required to continue offering thorough
critiques of dissenting voices or justifying why such voices ought to be dismissed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>3. Targeting dissent as an obstacle to public policy</title>
      <p>In an effort to prevent these consequences, scientists and science studies
scholars have responded by adopting a variety of interrelated strategies, all of
which target dissent perceived to be problematic so that it does not present an
obstacle to particular science-based policies. Three of them are particularly
common: masking disagreement, silencing or preventing what is taken to be
problematic dissent, and discrediting dissenters.</p>
      <p>
        One way to prevent the public and policymakers from being negatively
influenced by dissent is to present a so-called united front to the public, or what
Beatty refers to as “masking disagreement” by “joint acceptance”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Beatty 2006)</xref>
        .
In these cases, scientists may, for example, mask existing disagreements by
presenting to the public and policy makers only those scientific claims about
which they can all agree while omitting or downplaying those aspects about
which disagreements exist. For instance, although it is correct that there is
widespread agreement that average global temperature is increasing, there are also
general disagreements about how much warming will occur, how quickly it will
occur, and how best to prevent or mitigate it. Because presenting these
disagreements to the public is likely to create doubt and uncertainty not just about
the particular aspects about which there is disagreement but also about those for
which agreement exists, scientists might conceal discrepancies by presenting only
very general claims for which there are a consensus
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">(Oppenheimer et al. 2007)</xref>
        .
Such agreements are, strictly speaking, genuine agreements, but they are
generally over simplifications that ignore or mask existing disagreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This same strategy of emphasizing consensus has also been utilized by
science studies scholars attempting to defend certain scientific claims and
policies. Oreskes and Conway, for example, have responded to climate change
skeptics by showing that the overwhelming number of peer-reviewed articles
published support the claim that average global temperature is increasing and that
human activities are a significant cause
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref40 ref48 ref5 ref51 ref52 ref53 ref55 ref64">(Oreskes and Conway 2010b; Oreskes
2004)</xref>
        . They believe that, given the preponderance of evidence, rather than being
excessively careful about the uncertainty of any scientific knowledge claim,
climate scientists should now clearly label anthropogenic warming a fact
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref40 ref48 ref5 ref52 ref53 ref55 ref64 ref69">(Oreskes
and Conway 2010a)</xref>
        . Demonstrating the strength and breadth of the existing
scientific consensus is correctly thought to help put dissenting views in
perspective, so that they are not given more weight than they deserve. But the
emphasis on the existing consensus also works to mask the disagreements that do
exist as well as the validity of evidence that may contradict some prevalent
scientific assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second strategy for targeting dissent thought to pose an obstacle to
sound public policy is to silence dissenting views that are perceived to be
particularly problematic. For example, dissent can be hindered through the
peerreview process. In order to do so, papers are sent to experts in the field, who quite
likely will hold the prevailing view and who will be less sympathetic to dissenting
studies. That is, they will be more inclined to think that dissenting research must
be bad science. Of course, sometimes this will indeed be the case, but not always.
It is not easy to show that peer-review is used as a way to limit dissent
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(Martin
1999)</xref>
        . However, the highly publicized case of hacked emails from a computer
server at the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit (CRU) calls
attention to this strategy. Climate change scientists at the CRU came under fire
because in some of those stolen emails, researchers were apparently boasting
about how they could prevent articles with even the appearance of questioning
anthropogenic climate change from surviving peer review
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">(Schiermeier 2009)</xref>
        .
The Inspector General later found that there was no evidence that the CRU
scientists had done anything wrong
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">(NOAA 2011)</xref>
        . Nonetheless, this episode, as
well as the subsequent calls to take peer-review off its pedestal
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Horton 2010)</xref>
        ,
call attention to the ways in which peer-review might be used to suppress the
publication of research that dissent from widely accepted scientific claims
because it can interfere with the development of public policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        When dissenting articles or books are published, a third strategy that has
been employed by scientists and science scholars is to discredit the dissenter.
Science studies scholars have often responded to cases of manufactured dissent by
not just criticizing the science, but by publicizing the financial or political ties that
the dissenters have to think tanks or private industry
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref28 ref40 ref48 ref5 ref52 ref53 ref55 ref63 ref64">(Oreskes and Conway 2010;
Shrader-Frechette 2010, Elliott 2011)</xref>
        . Scientists have also attempted to discredit
putatively problematic dissenters. A recent example can be found in debates
about genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In 2007, the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) published a study that challenged the
general scientific consensus on the safety of GMOs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">(Rosi-Marshall et al. 2007)</xref>
        .
According to the study, cadis flies consuming Bt maize pollen died at twice the
rate of flies fed non-Bt maize pollen. Immediately after publication, not only the
evidence presented in the article, but also its authors were subjected to a relentless
and scathing attack by a group of scientists who favor biotech crops
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">(Waltz 2009)</xref>
        .
Arguing that one of their main motivations is the fear that anti-GMO interest
groups can seize on the study to advance their agenda, pro-GMO scientists helped
organize widespread and sustained criticism of the study. The attack was broad
ranging. Not only were the authors denounced for presumed glaring errors in
their scientific methodology and conclusions, criticisms were directed to the
PNAS for publishing the article as well as the National Science Foundation for
funding the study in the first place. Some of the participants even accused the
authors of misconduct. Given the variety of targets, it is not unreasonable to argue
that scientific issues were not the only concern. Even if the study were
scientifically flawed, and many other scientists thought that it was not, the
backlash seemed aimed more at discouraging research contrary to the received
scientific view of GMO safety than at presenting legitimate scientific concerns
about the paper
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">(Waltz 2009)</xref>
        . A potential consequence of this coordinated and
sustained strategy is the discouragement to conduct studies or publish findings
that may be counter to dominant views
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Frank 2004)</xref>
        . This strategy of discrediting
the dissenter can hinder dissent not just by making a particular scientist less
credible, it can also deter funding agencies from financing such research as well
as editors from publishing it. It may also have a general effect of deterring other
scientists from research that is inconsistent with widely accepted theories, insofar
as doing so will be risky to their careers.
      </p>
      <p>As we can see by these examples, attempts to protect policymaking from
dissenting views that attempt to challenge the scientific consensus can take a
variety of shapes and originate from players of different political persuasions. But
as mentioned earlier, what these strategies have in common is that those who use
them are concerned with preventing the negative effects that dissenting views can
present to sound policy development. Without dismissing the relevance of such
concerns, we argue here that targeting dissent as a way to protect public policy
making is both misguided and dangerous.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>4. Why targeting dissent is misguided</title>
      <p>Given the negative effects that a challenge to the scientific consensus by
dissenting voices can have, it might seem reasonable to attempt to use the
strategies mentioned, or similar ones, to protect sound public policy development.
But the belief that dissent is in these cases the appropriate target of concern is
grounded on a variety of assumptions that may not be justified. In what follows
we reconstruct and assess what we take to be the most plausible arguments that
can be presented to make sense of the belief that targeting dissent as an obstacle
to public policy is appropriate. We conclude that such arguments fail. We do not
claim that those who are worried about the negative policy effects of dissent
explicitly make these arguments. Our claim is simply that such concerns are
plausible only under these assumptions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>A. The consensus-as-necessary argument</title>
      <p>Concerns about dissent appear reasonable when scientific consensus is
taken to be a necessary condition for the development or enactment of sound
public policy. A plausible argument that could make sense of such concerns is
the following:
1. If a public policy P is to be justifiably enacted, then there must be a
consensus on some (pertinent) scientific truth Q.
2. The existence of dissenting voices undermines the scientific consensus
about Q.
3. Dissenting voices exist.
4. Therefore, consensus about Q is undermined, by Modus Ponens 2,3.
5. Therefore, public policy P cannot be justifiably enacted, by Modus</p>
      <p>Tollens 1,4.</p>
      <p>So, for example, one might argue that in order for regulations on
anthropogenic CO2 emissions to be justified, it must be the case that there is a
scientific consensus around the hypothesis that such emissions significantly
contribute to climate change. Climate deniers who challenge that view could then
undermine confidence in the scientific consensus and pose an obstacle to policy
regulations on CO2. Strategies used to block the effects of this dissent then seem
reasonable, as such strategies will eliminate a significant obstacle –dissenting
voices-- to the development of appropriate public policies. But the soundness of
this argument, and thus its ability to explain the appropriateness of targeting
dissenting voices, seems to be grounded on several controversial assumptions.</p>
      <p>First, as plausible as it may initially seem, the truth of premise 1 is
questionable as it is not obvious that the existence of a consensus is necessary for
making rational public policy. Often there are contexts in which we must adopt
public policies despite significant uncertainties and thus despite a lack of
consensus about the scientific evidence. For example, significant, and legitimate,
disagreement might exist about the extent or immediacy of climate change
impacts. Nonetheless, one might still argue that in the face of uncertainty, certain
risks are more acceptable than others. Hence, it might be rational to heavily
invest in alternative energies or reduce greenhouse gas emissions because the risk
of unnecessary economic costs might be more acceptable than the risks of doing
nothing and being wrong.</p>
      <p>
        Second, even if one assumes that premise 1 is true, the argument’s
soundness seems to depend on what constitutes scientific consensus. If one
assumes that the consensus needed for public policy involves unanimity
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">(Tucker
2003)</xref>
        , then the existence of any dissenting voices might indeed be a problem for
the scientific consensus and an obstacle to public policy development. Under the
consensus-as-unanimity view, concerns about dissenting voices would then be
understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the requirement of a unanimous consensus among scientists seems
problematic for a variety of reasons
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref21 ref28 ref40 ref48 ref5 ref52 ref53 ref55 ref64 ref65">(Gilbert 1987; Beatty and Moore 2010;
Longino 2002; Solomon 2001; Ackermann 1986)</xref>
        . First, as many have
acknowledged, unanimity can be difficult to come by even when the epistemic
agents are rational
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">(Rosen 2001)</xref>
        . There is significant evidence that, even in the
same discipline, scientists’ inferences are subject to contextual values, differences
in background assumptions, the use of various inferential principles, and
differences in theory assessment strategies, which may make unanimity
impossible
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref35 ref45 ref45 ref65 ref8">(Solomon 2001; Longino 1990, 2002; Moffett 2007; Dietrich and
Skipper 2007)</xref>
        . Second, even if possible, requiring unanimity might not be
epistemically desirable. Some have argued that the existence of a dissenting
minority is likely to strengthen a consensus as there would be confidence that the
agreed upon position has been tested against other worthy alternatives
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref23 ref28 ref40 ref43 ref48 ref5 ref52 ref53 ref55 ref64 ref65">(Elster
1986; Beatty and Moore 2010; Gutmann 2004; Mill 1978; Longino 2002;
Solomon 2001)</xref>
        . Third, the requirement of unanimity would actually give
disproportionate power to dissenting views, whether or not the dissenting views
are reasonable, because one or a few expressions of disagreement will be
sufficient to prevent a unanimous agreement
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref40 ref48 ref5 ref52 ref53 ref55 ref64">(Beatty and Moore 2010)</xref>
        . In other
words, it would give a single dissenting voice a “veto power” with greater
influence on the outcome than a single advocate of the consensus view. Hence,
the requirement of unanimity itself creates the need for strategies that call for
blocking the negative effects of dissent. It makes dissenting voices, whether those
dissenting voices are justified or not, a more serious threat to the authority of
science, and thus a significantly more robust obstacle to public policy.
      </p>
      <p>But if the consensus required in premise 1 does not involve unanimity but
allows for the existence of a dissenting minority, then how should we understand
premise 2’s claim that dissenting voices undermine scientific consensus and thus
present an obstacle to enactment of a particular policy? Premise 2 might
plausibly be interpreted as making an epistemically normative claim that there are
some dissenting voices that appropriately undermine consensus and with it the
justification for adopting certain policies. Perhaps, for example, dissent might
appropriately undermine the consensus view when it receives a significant amount
of uptake after careful consideration, or when it reflects persistent anomalies not
explained by the consensus view, or when it is advocated by a diverse group of
scientists who have no shared political or economic interest at stake. Indeed, it
seems right to say that if such dissent existed, our confidence in the consensus
view ought to decrease.</p>
      <p>
        In this case, however, those who target dissent would need to have an
account of how to distinguish between dissent that would legitimately undermine
the scientific consensus and dissent that would not do so. However, even among
those who have targeted dissent as an obstacle to public policy, it is difficult to
find a systematic defense of what kind or under what conditions dissent is
appropriately consensus-undermining or not. Indeed, a review of a variety of
cases where dissenting voices have been suppressed, their motives criticized, or

        . This failure might have to do with a variety of factors, such as
the difficulty of determining the quality of scientific deliberations, the conditions
under which consensus is achieved, the composition of scientific communities, or
the epistemic authority given to the dissenters during deliberations, all of which
are likely to influence determinations about whether a particular dissent is
consensus-undermining or consensus-strengthening

      <p>More importantly, if premise 2 implicitly presupposes a epistemically
normative distinction, then to the extent that premise 2 refers only to instances of
dissent that are appropriately consensus-undermining, this has implications for
how we can understand premise 3’s assertion that dissenting voices exist. In
order for the argument to be valid, it will not be sufficient to show that some
dissenting voices exist. Rather, premise 3 must be understood as claiming that the
dissent in question is appropriately consensus-undermining (such that it would
pose a threat to policy). But if this is the case, then such dissent may well present
a legitimate obstacle to the policy in question. That is, if the dissent is legitimate
dissent that rationally undermines consensus and the justification for a particular
policy, then it is not the sort of dissent that should be discouraged or dismissed. If
this is correct, this argument fails to provide justifications to target dissent as an
obstacle to public policy. Clearly, critics of dissent are concerned about dissent
that would inappropriately undermine the consensus –and thus inappropriately
challenge public policy.</p>
      <p>Perhaps then premise 2 is best understood as a descriptive claim about
laypersons’ perceptions, rather than referring to dissent that would appropriately
undermine scientific consensus. Policymakers or the public, insofar as they lack
the expertise necessary to be able to accurately assess the quality or weight of
dissenting studies in relation to existing scientific evidence, may not be able to
distinguish appropriate and inappropriate instances of dissent. As a result, they
may mistakenly believe all dissent to be consensus-undermining. If so, the public
will erroneously take any dissenting voices to call into question the scientific
consensus. Dissenting voices should be targeted then, it might be argued, because
of their practical implications for public policy developments: they will cause
laypersons to think that there is no scientific consensus, even when there is one.
Believing that scientific consensus is missing, policy makers and the public might
conclude that the rational grounds for a particular public policy are lacking and
therefore that such policies should not be enacted. Strategies that target dissent, on
this view, are pragmatic tactics aimed at trying to prevent such confusion and
remove an illegitimate obstacle to public policy.</p>
      <p>Interpreting premise 2 in this way then, makes the targeting of dissent
appear reasonable. And this interpretation seems indeed quite plausible when one
reflects on the instances of dissent that have received the most negative attention.
Those who have targeted dissent as an obstacle to public policy do not take
climate deniers, tobacco scientists, and creationists to provide the sort of dissent
that is epistemically valuable and can appropriately undermine scientific
consensus. Their fear is that the public and policy makers would however
incorrectly see the dissenters’ claims as challenges to the scientific consensus and
thus would fail to enact or support scientifically-grounded public policies. This
argument would then serve to justify the targeting of dissenting voices that,
although not really a source of concern for scientific knowledge, are perceived by
the public and policy makers to be so.</p>
      <p>Yet, even if this interpretation of the argument justifies the targeting of
dissent as a way to eliminate an illegitimate obstacle to public policy making, it is
not clear that such is the best way to address the problem. Clearly, the problem
that inappropriate dissent presents to the enactment of rational public policy is the
result not only of the existence of such voices but also, and more fundamentally,
of incorrect assumptions that laypersons apparently have about the nature of
dissent and scientific consensus and their role in sound public policy making. If
so, addressing the problem does not necessarily require masking or quelling
dissent, even when such dissent is illegitimate from an epistemic point of view,
but could also be addressed by educating the public and policymakers about what
constitutes scientific consensus, how to distinguish between dissent that is
appropriately consensus-undermining and that which is not, as well as about the
appropriate relationships between scientific knowledge and public policy.</p>
      <p>Of course, one might argue that such education is likely to be too difficult
and it would be more effective to get the public and policy makers to disregard
dissent that the scientific community deems inappropriate. There is, however,
something very paternalistic about this approach. It appears to require
deliberately misleading the public about the nature of scientific consensus and the
relationship between dissent and public policy “for their own good.” This
paternalism seems unjustified as there is a non-paternalistic alternative for
addressing the problem. More importantly, as the recent disputes on climate
change, intelligent design, or GMOs reflect, it is doubtful that current efforts to
get policymakers and the public to disregard dissent is any less challenging than
efforts to ensure a more adequate understanding of scientific consensus, dissent,
and their relationships to public policy.</p>
      <p>Moreover, strategies that mask or suppress dissent present problems that
the education alternative does not face. Such strategies reinforce the false
perception among laypersons that if there were any dissent, it would undermine
scientific consensus and its authority to support public policy. This is what
actually motivates special interests to manufacture dissent in the first place. That
is, they aim to exploit the false perception that (any) dissent undermines the
existence of scientific consensus and presents an obstacle to policy. We will
return to this concern in section 5, where we will argue that targeting dissent has
additional dangerous consequences that make educating the public a better
strategy for addressing the problem.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>B. The consensus-as sufficient argument</title>
      <p>Another option that makes sense of concerns about dissent and justifies the
targeting of dissenting voices takes scientific consensus to be not necessary for
the development or enactment of sound public policy but sufficient. A plausible
reconstruction of the argument would be the following:
1. If there is a consensus on some (pertinent) scientific truth Q, then
public policy P is to be justifiably enacted
2. The existence of dissenting voices appears to1 undermine the scientific
consensus around Q.
3. Successfully targeting those dissenting voices will preserve the
consensus around Q.
4. Dissenting voices are to be targeted.
5. Therefore, consensus about Q is preserved, by Modus Ponens 3,4
6. Therefore, public policy P can be justifiably enacted, by Modus</p>
      <p>Ponens 1,5</p>
      <p>This sort of reasoning might seem plausible. For example, one might
argue that if there were a consensus that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions
are a significant contributor to climate change, then a policy reducing greenhouse
gas emissions would be justified. If this were true, then targeting problematic
1 Notice that in this argument premise 2 cannot be taken to presuppose an epistemically normative
conception of dissent. If premise 2 were to rely on a normative understanding of dissent then the
argument would be invalid as the dissent to which premises 3 and 4 refer could not be the same
type of dissent as that of premise 2. In a normative reading of premise 2, the dissent that
undermines the scientific consensus would do so appropriately, but if so we would not want to
condemn such dissent because such dissent would be epistemically relevant.
dissent would be reasonable insofar as it would help preserve the justification for
emission regulations and remove a significant obstacle to public policy.</p>
      <p>The assumption that consensus is sufficient for a particular policy might
seem particularly reasonable when one is confronted with policy options that
appear to be relatively straightforward. For example, the existence of a scientific
consensus that tobacco causes cancer might appear sufficient to ground the
enactment of, say, smoking restrictions.</p>
      <p>
        Yet no matter how initially plausible, the assumption that consensus is
sufficient for the enactment of particular public policies is false. Take, for
example, the case of biotech crops. Many have argued that there is a scientific
consensus on the safety of GMOs. They argue that the evidence clearly shows
that biotech crops, such as Bt corn, pose no serious harms to the health of humans,
other animals, and the environment. Policies that promote widespread use of this
new agricultural biotechnology are then said to be science-based, while policies
that restrict the use of these crops are thought to be unscientific
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref2 ref24 ref44 ref59">(Hodgson 2008;
Arntzen et al. 2003; Editorial 2007; Miller 2003; Saleh-Lakha and Glick 2005)</xref>
        .
But it is obviously not the case that a consensus around the safety of GMOs is
sufficient to justify the widespread use of such technologies. This incorrectly
presupposes that health risks are the sole significant concern in the widespread
implementation of GMOs. But, even if GMOs had no hazardous health
consequences, there may be other reasons to restrict their use
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Lacey 2005)</xref>
        , all of
which would be perfectly consistent with the recognition that indeed GMOs do
not pose serious health risks. For example, one might reject public polices that
promote wide use of biotech crops because they present a threat to genetic
diversity. Similarly, some have argued that transgenic seeds are not only
biological entities, but also bearers of intellectual property rights and thus they
can be used to exercise control over the agricultural systems in which they are
used. Currently, a few companies own the vast majority of the patents for various
GM plants, which means that farmers worldwide must purchase their seed stock
from them. Concerns about the developing world’s increased dependence on the
interests of the global-market and the effects that this might have on people’s
well-being, and not just worries about health risks can thus ground rejection of
public policies encouraging an extensive use of GMOs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39 ref9">(de Melo-Martín and
Meghani 2008)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>The reason then that the truth of premise 1 might appear uncontroversial is
that in many cases there exist widely shared background assumptions that are
implicitly doing important work. For instance, it might seem unproblematic to
argue that we should adopt smoking restrictions in light of the consensus that
smoking causes cancer. But such is because most people value their health and
tend to believe that an important goal of public policy is to protect public health.
In this case, however, it is these additional value judgments operating as
background assumptions, and not the scientific consensus alone that help
determine what policy ought to be adopted.</p>
      <p>If this is the case, then worries about scientific dissent appear again to be
misguided. The problem is once more not with dissent but the incorrect
assumption that scientific consensus is sufficient to establish particular public
policy options. The choice of public policies is a complex activity. A variety of
factors can legitimately be taken into account when defending particular policies.
Scientific evidence ought to be one of those factors, but it is clearly not the only
one. At times, legitimate economic, scientific, social, and political factors might
enter into conflict when determining what policy option is best. Reasonable
disagreements can exist about which factors are weightier.</p>
      <p>If we are correct, targeting dissent as an obstacle to public policy will not
address the real problem, that is, the need to ensure that particular public polices,
thought to be grounded on the scientific evidence, are enacted. An effective
solution will necessarily involve helping the public and policymakers better
understand the nature of scientific consensus and dissent, and the role that
scientific knowledge can play in directing public policy. While we recognize that
this sort of education would be challenging to accomplish, it would address the
real problem at stake: protecting rational policymaking.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>5. Why targeting dissent is dangerous</title>
      <p>Targeting scientific dissent as an obstacle to public policy is not only misguided,
as it focuses on the wrong aspect of the problem, but also dangerous. This is the
case for several reasons. First, it can contribute to the very sorts of problems
critics of dissent seek to address, that is, it can actually increase instances of
dissenting voices that are merely aimed to create public doubt rather than to
answer scientific questions. This is so because it can reinforce incorrect
assumptions, discussed earlier, about the nature of consensus and dissent and their
relationships to sound public policy making. As a result, it provides incentive to
create doubt by those who would like to see those policies thwarted. If people
believe that a good way to undermine an undesirable –economically or
ideologically-- policy outcome is to challenge the science that presumably
grounds such policy, they will find the manufacture of dissent an appealing and
productive strategy. Moreover, in the minds of the public and policymakers,
targeting dissent reinforces the idea that the dissent in question is appropriately
consensus-undermining, when in fact it is not. Thus, as we mentioned earlier, a
more promising strategy would be to educate the public and policy makers about
the complex relationships between scientific knowledge and public policy.</p>
      <p>
        Second, targeting dissent can also be used to promote special interest
science. Those who target dissent because they are concerned about the role of
private interests in manufacturing doubt, need to keep in mind that these interests
can just as easily work to suppress dissent that is appropriately
consensusundermining as they can work to create dissent that is not so. For instance, some
are concerned that in the GMO case, companies such as Monsanto are heavily
funding the research that supports the now dominant view that GMOs do not pose
a significant threat to health. Such interests are equally capable of using their
resources to manufacture consensus by suppressing or discrediting dissenting
voices that could actually appropriately undermine the scientific consensus for
instance, as they are to create doubt through epistemically inappropriate dissent.
Criticisms of dissent may thus discourage the very sorts of arguments that are
necessary to counter the influence of commercial interests. After all, the claims
for which scientific consensus exists change over time and can come from all
sides of the aisle
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(Kuehn 2004)</xref>
        . A few decades ago, the claims that nicotine was
not addictive or that smoking did not cause lung cancer were widely accepted by
the scientific community. When dissenters attempted to challenge such consensus,
tobacco companies seemed perfectly eager both to fund research that reinforced
the presumed consensus of the time and suppressed dissenting voices by
mounting serious attacks on the careers of scientists
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(Martin 1999)</xref>
        . Targeting
dissent as an obstacle to public policy, then, has the potential to strip away the
resources needed precisely to guard against the influences of special interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, repudiation of dissent is likely to stifle legitimate dissenting voices,
which will serve neither science nor public policy. That is, focus on dissent and
its negative effects on public policy and public behavior might result in a “chilling
effect” where dissent that is appropriately consensus-undermining is silenced.
Scientists may be reluctant to voice dissenting views insofar as doing so may
harm their reputations, limit their careers, or undermine prevailing theories or
policies, which they care about deeply. For instance, Beatty shows how a panel
of scientists for the U.S. National Academy of Sciences omitted their wildly
different predictions about the genetic harms of radiation when presenting a risk
assessment of radiation in 1956
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Beatty 2006)</xref>
        . They did not include the range of
predictions in their final report precisely because they thought the differences
would undermine confidence in their recommendations. Yet this range could
have been very relevant to decisions policymakers had to make about what levels
of exposure to radiation would be acceptable. Some evidence indicates that this
potential “chilling effect” can now be seen in climate science research. There are
genuine disagreements about how, for example, to best model cloud formation,
water vapor feedback, and aerosols in General Circulation Models (GCMs), all of
which have significant impacts on the magnitude of warming likely to occur
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref26 ref56 ref71">(IPCC 2007; Weare 2000a, 2000b; Rind et al. 2009)</xref>
        . Yet, some scientists are
reluctant to make these disagreements public, for fear that they will be accused of
being denialists, faulted for confusing the public and policymakers, censured for
abating climate change deniers, or criticized for undermining needed public
policy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">(Pidgeon and Fischoff 2011; Schiermeier 2010)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Of course, targeting dissent as an obstacle to public policy can reinforce
not just self-censorship, but the suppression of legitimate dissenting voices using
strategies mentioned earlier, from censorship by peer-reviewers, editors and
funding sources, to artificial creation of scientific consensus. Unfortunately, if
criticisms of dissent result in the stifling of dissent that is appropriately
consensus-undermining, dissenting voices that could have been crucial to helping
the scientific community discover new truths might also be blocked out. If this
happens, scientific progress is hindered. This is particularly relevant in the case of
the biomedical sciences, where consensus in clinical practice is often difficult to
challenge.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>6. Conclusion</title>
      <p>We have argued that targeting dissent as an obstacle to public policy is
both misguided and dangerous. It is misguided because it fails to focus on the real
problems at stake: understanding the nature and role of scientific consensus and
dissent, as well as the relationship between scientific evidence and public policy.
It is dangerous because it is likely to increase illegitimate instances of dissent,
deprive us of resources to criticize special interest science, and stifle legitimate
scientific dissent that is crucial to scientific progress and sound public policy.</p>
      <p>Our intention has not been to defend “special interest science,” deny the
value of scientific consensus, or dismiss the problematic consequences that
dissent can cause in certain cases. On the contrary, it is precisely these concerns
that lead us to our thesis. If our arguments are correct, the problem is not with
dissent as such, even dissent that is not epistemically valuable, but with an
incorrect understanding of the nature of consensus and dissent and their role in
sound public policy making. Addressing the real target should be our aim.
Moreover, this demonstrates that science studies scholars should direct their
attention towards questions such as: What are the factors that make policy
decisions rational? How much agreement must exist within a scientific
community to help justify particular policies? When is dissent a threat to the
scientific consensus? When is it appropriate for policymakers to ignore
dissenting voices? Is there something particularly problematic about the sort of
dissent that occurs in cases of special interest science that distinguishes it from
dissenting views that are offered in good faith? We have not attempted to answer
these questions here. Our claim, however, is that in the context of science
relevant to public policy, concerns about manufactured dissent would be better
addressed by an examination of these questions, rather than by focusing on
dissent as a problematic activity.</p>
